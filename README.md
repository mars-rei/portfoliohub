# portfoliohub
My final year project PortfolioHub: a portfolio site builder tailored for those in the creative industries.

Commands to help when running:

php -S localhost:8000 -t public (same as artisan serve since my ports are not currently working)


Notes as of 010226:
- Inertia.js instead of Blade, and combining the frontend and backend instead of having them separate may be better and easier to manage than original plan
